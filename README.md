I noticed ta, talib and my own EMA functions qives slightly different results in spite of basic EMA function sense is very simple and straightforward. 

So made some research to understand that. You better watch yourself using the graph first and than go to code. 

The code is pretty obvious but I hope it will help to save time to some colleagues. Peace all!

As well you could use it with own dataset instead of my sample datase. Or load some from Yahoo finance etc.
